Who wouldnt want a turtle as a pet. They are awesome fascinating creatures, and its our job to provides these precious creatures.
We are very careful when it comes to breeding turtles. The breeding usually occurrs almost year round, just not when it is cold.
Turtles usually only breed when it is around 50-77 degrees Farhenheit. Around that time turtkes will mate and They will lay their
eggs around 6 weeks later. We then allow natrual birth and allow the mother to take care of the eggs until theyre hatched.
When the eggs are hatched, the mother considers her job done. We keep these turtles well nurtured and hope they find a new 
family that is perfect for them.
